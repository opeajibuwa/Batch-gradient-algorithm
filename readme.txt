There is only one python file, which can generate the lineplots for different learning rates. The lineplots will be save in the path defined by variable "MSE_plot_save_path" in main function. The lineplots are generated separately. Each execution of python file will also print the MSE value for validation set on the console.

All the questions in the homework are covered in the implementation code in IA1.py

1. Please activate python3 virtual environment in the same directory where the python file and the data are. Please make sure the data files and python file are under the same folder.
2. Please install these python3 packages under the virtual environment: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. 
3. To run the program, please use the following command: python IA1.py

I've tested on the babylon server, so the python file should work~^_^
